                Increasingly, social connection is understood as a core human need, and the desire to connect as a fundamental drive.It is crucial to development; without it, social animals experience distress and face severe developmental consequences. In humans, one of the most social species, social connection is essential to nearly every aspect of health and well-being. Lack of connection, or loneliness, has been linked to inflammation,accelerated aging and cardiovascular health risk, suicide, and all-cause mortality.
                <br><br>
                
                Feeling socially connected depends on the quality and number of meaningful relationships one has with family, friends, and acquaintances. Going beyond the individual level, it also involves a feeling of connecting to a larger community. Connectedness on a community level has profound benefits for both individuals and society.</p>
